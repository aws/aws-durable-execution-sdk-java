## Configuration

Customize SDK behavior by overriding `createConfiguration()` in your handler:

```java
public class OrderProcessor extends DurableHandler<Order, OrderResult> {

    @Override
    protected DurableConfig createConfiguration() {
        // Custom Lambda client with connection pooling
        var lambdaClientBuilder = LambdaClient.builder()
            .httpClient(ApacheHttpClient.builder()
                .maxConnections(50)
                .connectionTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
                .build());

        return DurableConfig.builder()
            .withLambdaClientBuilder(lambdaClientBuilder)
            .withSerDes(new MyCustomSerDes())           // Custom serialization
            .withExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10))  // Custom thread pool
            .withLoggerConfig(LoggerConfig.withReplayLogging())     // Enable replay logs
            .build();
    }

    @Override
    protected OrderResult handleRequest(Order order, DurableContext ctx) {
        // Your handler logic
    }
}
```

| Option                      | Description                             | Default                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `withLambdaClientBuilder()` | Custom AWS Lambda client                | Auto-configured Lambda client |
| `withSerDes()`              | Serializer for step results             | Jackson with default settings |
| `withExecutorService()`     | Thread pool for user-defined operations | Cached daemon thread pool     |
| `withLoggerConfig()`        | Logger behavior configuration           | Suppress logs during replay   |
| `withPollingStrategy()`     | Backend polling strategy                | Exponential backoff: 1s base, 2x rate, FULL jitter, 10s max |
| `withCheckpointDelay()`     | How often the SDK checkpoints updates   | `Duration.ofSeconds(0)` (as soon as possible) |

The `withExecutorService()` option configures the thread pool used for running user-defined operations. Internal SDK coordination (checkpoint batching, polling) runs on an SDK-managed thread pool.

### Dynamic plugin loading

Dynamic plugin loading is an opt-in alternative to registering plugins in application code. Put provider JARs on the application class path, then set `DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS` to an ordered, comma-separated list of provider names:

```text
DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS=otel-invocation,com.example.audit
```

When the variable is unset or blank, the SDK does not perform provider discovery. During `DurableConfig` construction, the SDK uses `ServiceLoader` and the thread context class loader to find `DurableExecutionPluginProvider` implementations. Only named providers create plugins.

Dynamically loaded plugins run first in the order listed in `DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS`. Plugins registered through `withPlugins(...)` follow in configuration order. Both sources are additive: if the same plugin is selected dynamically and registered explicitly, both factories are registered and each produces an instance that receives lifecycle hooks. Duplicate configured provider names, duplicate discovered provider names, missing providers, provider discovery failures, and selected providers that were built against an older SDK and do not implement `createPlugin(InvocationInfo)` stop configuration with an `IllegalStateException`.

To distribute a provider in a Lambda layer, package its JAR under `java/lib`:

```text
my-plugin-layer.zip
`-- java
    `-- lib
        `-- my-durable-plugin.jar
```

The provider JAR must contain:

```text
META-INF/services/software.amazon.lambda.durable.plugin.DurableExecutionPluginProvider
```

The service file contains the provider implementation class name. A provider is itself the per-invocation plugin factory: the SDK calls `createPlugin(InvocationInfo)` once per Lambda invocation and drops the returned instance when that invocation returns, so the instance can hold its invocation's state in plain fields. A minimal provider looks like:

```java
public final class AuditPluginProvider implements DurableExecutionPluginProvider {
    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "com.example.audit";
    }

    @Override
    public DurableExecutionPlugin createPlugin(InvocationInfo invocationInfo) {
        return new AuditPlugin(invocationInfo.durableExecutionArn());
    }
}
```

Provider-specific settings can use namespaced environment variables. If an application shades provider JARs into one artifact, its build must preserve and merge `META-INF/services` entries.
