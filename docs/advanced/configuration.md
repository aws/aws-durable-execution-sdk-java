## Configuration

Customize SDK behavior by overriding `createConfiguration()` in your handler:

```java
public class OrderProcessor extends DurableHandler<Order, OrderResult> {

    @Override
    protected DurableConfig createConfiguration() {
        // Custom Lambda client with connection pooling
        var lambdaClientBuilder = LambdaClient.builder()
            .httpClient(ApacheHttpClient.builder()
                .maxConnections(50)
                .connectionTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
                .build());

        return DurableConfig.builder()
            .withLambdaClientBuilder(lambdaClientBuilder)
            .withSerDes(new MyCustomSerDes())           // Custom serialization
            .withExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10))  // Custom thread pool
            .withLoggerConfig(LoggerConfig.withReplayLogging())     // Enable replay logs
            .build();
    }

    @Override
    protected OrderResult handleRequest(Order order, DurableContext ctx) {
        // Your handler logic
    }
}
```

| Option                      | Description                             | Default                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `withLambdaClientBuilder()` | Custom AWS Lambda client                | Auto-configured Lambda client |
| `withSerDes()`              | Serializer for step results             | Jackson with default settings |
| `withExecutorService()`     | Thread pool for user-defined operations | Cached daemon thread pool     |
| `withInvocationExecutorFactory()` | Factory for isolated per-invocation user executors | Disabled |
| `withLoggerConfig()`        | Logger behavior configuration           | Suppress logs during replay   |
| `withPollingStrategy()`     | Backend polling strategy                | Exponential backoff: 1s base, 2x rate, FULL jitter, 10s max |
| `withCheckpointDelay()`     | How often the SDK checkpoints updates   | `Duration.ofSeconds(0)` (as soon as possible) |

The `withExecutorService()` option configures a caller-owned executor shared by every invocation that uses the configuration. The SDK never shuts it down. To isolate concurrent Lambda Managed Instances invocations, configure a factory instead:

```java
DurableConfig.builder()
    .withInvocationExecutorFactory(() -> Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4))
    .build();
```

The factory is called once per invocation and may be called concurrently on Lambda Managed Instances. It must return a fresh executor, which the SDK drains and shuts down before returning the invocation response. Returning an executor already leased to an active invocation is rejected. The factory and `withExecutorService()` are mutually exclusive. Both options run all user code, including the root handler, steps, and child contexts. Internal SDK coordination such as checkpoint batching and polling remains on the SDK-managed executor.

A bounded executor supplied through `withExecutorService()` remains shared. On Lambda Managed Instances, concurrent roots can occupy all of its workers while waiting for queued steps. Use the invocation factory when capacity must be isolated between native invocations. Isolation does not define the capacity required by arbitrarily nested synchronous child contexts; size or design those separately.

### Dynamic plugin loading

Dynamic plugin loading is an opt-in alternative to registering plugins in application code. Put provider JARs on the application class path, then set `DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS` to an ordered, comma-separated list of provider names:

```text
DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS=otel-invocation,com.example.audit
```

When the variable is unset or blank, the SDK does not perform provider discovery. During `DurableConfig` construction, the SDK uses `ServiceLoader` and the thread context class loader to find `DurableExecutionPluginProvider` implementations. Only named providers create plugins.

Dynamically loaded plugins run first in the order listed in `DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS`. Plugins registered through `withPlugins(...)` follow in configuration order. Both sources are additive: if the same plugin type is selected dynamically and registered explicitly, both instances are registered and receive lifecycle hooks. Duplicate configured provider names, duplicate discovered provider names, missing providers, incompatible provider API versions, invalid plugin types, and provider construction failures stop configuration with an `IllegalStateException`.

To distribute a provider in a Lambda layer, package its JAR under `java/lib`:

```text
my-plugin-layer.zip
`-- java
    `-- lib
        `-- my-durable-plugin.jar
```

The provider JAR must contain:

```text
META-INF/services/software.amazon.lambda.durable.plugin.DurableExecutionPluginProvider
```

The service file contains the provider implementation class name. A minimal provider looks like:

```java
public final class AuditPluginProvider implements DurableExecutionPluginProvider {
    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "com.example.audit";
    }

    @Override
    public int getApiVersion() {
        return API_VERSION;
    }

    @Override
    public Class<? extends DurableExecutionPlugin> getPluginType() {
        return AuditPlugin.class;
    }

    @Override
    public DurableExecutionPlugin createPlugin() {
        return new AuditPlugin();
    }
}
```

Provider-specific settings can use namespaced environment variables. If an application shades provider JARs into one artifact, its build must preserve and merge `META-INF/services` entries.
